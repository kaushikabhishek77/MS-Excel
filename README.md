The transaction data is present in Original Sheet tab of [transaction data file](https://github.com/kaushikabhishek77/MS-Excel/blob/c7f5645add9b14c43297704a1c7f7c0bcef3a4a1/Excel%20CapstoneTransactionData_.xlsx).

There are four levels of analysis - Order Level Analysis, Completion Rate Analysis, Customer Level Analysis and Delivery Analysis.

Order Level Analysis contains answer to several key questions such as order distribution by slot and area, areas witnessing highest monthly increase in orders and so on. 

Completion Rate Analysis pertains to completion rate i.e. percentage of successful orders, and whether this metric varies by slot(afternoon, evening etc.) or by day of week etc.

Customer Level Analysis contains some metrics such as Customer Life Time Value grouped by source of acquisition and acquisition month. It also includes average revenue by acquisition source and month and any other key derived insights.

Delivery Analysis explores the average delivery time and whether if it varies by slot, place and month etc.
